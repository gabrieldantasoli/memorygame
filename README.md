This is a memory game made with HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT . 

the user has to memorize the sequence of events that will appear on the screen. The game difficulty increases gradually and as soon as the user loses the game his record will be scored. if the player gets a score higher than one of the three best places he will be able to put his name in the ranking of the best players. the game has three difficulties (easy, medium and hard).
